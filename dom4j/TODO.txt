TO DO LIST
==========

By all means help yourself to any of these tasks if you fancy
rolling your sleeves up and doing some development, tuning, testing or 
documentation. Any contributions will be greatly received.



Development Tasks
=================

* JDBC ResultSet implementation of an Element so that XPath and XSLT can be
easily done on a JDBC result set.

* Integrate Dennis Sosnoski's XML-Stream work for the default serialization 
mechansism

* Support XPath and XSLT patterns in the ElementHandler mechansim

* As suggested by Kesav Kumar Kolla, implement a better, mutable Swing TreeModel
  possibly along with an optional document event mechansim

* get the DOM implementation to pass the DOM conformance tests at
  http://xmlconf.sourceforge.net/

* a persistent dom4j implementation using XMLDB or some other persistence 
  mechansim



Documentation
=============
* the section headings are not working correctly in the DocBook stylesheets
used for the cookbook (in dom4j/src/doc/cookbook/style/html).
