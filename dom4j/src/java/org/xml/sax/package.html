<p> This package provides the core SAX APIs.
Some SAX1 APIs are deprecated to encourage integration of
namespace-awareness into designs of new applications
and into maintenance of existing infrastructure. </p>

<h2> SAX2 Standard Feature Flags </h2>

<p> One of the essential characteristics of SAX2 is that it added
feature flags which can be used to examine and perhaps modify
parser modes, in particular modes such as validation.
Since features are identified by (absolute) URIs, anyone
can define such features.   
Currently defined standard feature URIs have the prefix
<code>http://xml.org/sax/features/</code> before an identifier such as
<code>validation</code>.  Turn features on or off using
<em>setFeature</em>.  Those standard identifiers are: </p>


<table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
    <tr align="center" bgcolor="#ccccff">
	<th>Feature ID</th>
	<th>Default</th>
	<th>Description</th>
	</tr>

    <tr>
	<td>external-general-entities</td>
	<td><em>unspecified</em></td>
	<td> Reports whether this parser processes external
	    general entities; always true if validating</td>
	</tr>

    <tr>
	<td>external-parameter-entities</td>
	<td><em>unspecified</em></td>
	<td> Reports whether this parser processes external
	    parameter entities; always true if validating</td>
	</tr>

    <tr>
	<td>is-standalone</td>
	<td><em>none</em></td>
	<td> May be examined only during a parse, after the
	    <em>startDocument()</em> callback has been completed; read-only.
	    The value is true if the document specified the
	    "standalone" flag in its XML declaration,
	    and otherwise is false. </td>
	</tr>

    <tr>
	<td>lexical-handler/parameter-entities</td>
	<td><em>unspecified</em></td>
	<td> true indicates that the LexicalHandler will report the
	    beginning and end of parameter entities
	    </td>
	</tr>

    <tr>
	<td>namespaces</td>
	<td>true</td>
	<td> true indicates namespace URIs and unprefixed local names
	    for element and attribute names will be available </td>
	</tr>

    <tr>
	<td>namespace-prefixes</td> <td>false</td> <td> true indicates
	XML qualified names (with prefixes) and attributes (including
	<em>xmlns*</em> attributes) will be available </td>
	</tr>

    <tr>
	<td>resolve-dtd-uris</td>
	<td><em>true</em></td>
	<td> A value of "true" indicates that system IDs in declarations will
	    be absolutized (relative to their base URIs) before reporting.
	    (That is the default behavior for all SAX2 XML parsers.)
	    A value of "false" indicates those IDs will not be absolutized;
	    parsers will provide the base URI from
	    <em>Locator.getSystemId()</em>.
	    This applies to system IDs passed in <ul>
		<li><em>DTDHandler.notationDecl()</em>,
		<li><em>DTDHandler.unparsedEntityDecl()</em>, and
		<li><em>DeclHandler.externalEntityDecl()</em>.
	    </ul>
	    It does not apply to <em>EntityResolver.resolveEntity()</em>,
	    which is not used to report declarations, or to
	    <em>LexicalHandler.startDTD()</em>, which already provides
	    the non-absolutized URI.
	    </td>
	</tr>

    <tr>
	<td>string-interning</td>
	<td><em>unspecified</em></td>
	<td> true if all XML names (for elements, prefixes, attributes,
	    entities, notations, and local names),
	    as well as Namespace URIs, will have been interned
	    using <em>java.lang.String.intern</em>. This supports fast
	    testing of equality/inequality against string constants,
	    rather than forcing slower calls to <em>String.equals()</em>.

	    That interface exposes additional DTD-related information,
	    such as whether the attribute was specified in the
	    source text rather than defaulted.
	    </td>
	</tr>

    <tr>
	<td>use-locator2</td>
	<td><em>unspecified</em></td>
	<td> Returns true if the <em>Locator</em> objects passed by
	    this parser in <em>ContentHandler.setDocumentLocator()</em>

	<td> Controls whether, when the <em>namespace-prefixes</em> feature
	    is set, the parser treats namespace declaration attributes as

	    By default, SAX2 conforms to the original "Namespaces in XML"
	    Recommendation, which explicitly states that such attributes are
	    not in any namespace.
	    Setting this optional flag to true makes the SAX2 events conform to
	    a later backwards-incompatible revision of that recommendation,
	    placing those attributes in a namespace.
	    </td>
	</tr>

</table>

<p> Support for the default values of the
<em>namespaces</em> and <em>namespace-prefixes</em>
properties is required.
Support for any other feature flags is entirely optional.
</p>

<p> For default values not specified by SAX2,
each XMLReader implementation specifies its default,
or may choose not to expose the feature flag.
Unless otherwise specified here,
implementations may support changing current values
of these standard feature flags, but not while parsing.
</p>

<h2> SAX2 Standard Handler and Property IDs </h2>

<p> For parser interface characteristics that are described
as objects, a separate namespace is defined.  The
objects in this namespace are again identified by URI, and
the standard property URIs have the prefix
<code>http://xml.org/sax/properties/</code> before an identifier such as
<code>lexical-handler</code> or
<code>dom-node</code>.  Manage those properties using
<em>setProperty()</em>.  Those identifiers are: </p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
    <tr align="center" bgcolor="#ccccff">
	<th>Property ID</th>
	<th>Description</th>
	</tr>

    <tr>
	<td>declaration-handler</td>
	<td> Used to see most DTD declarations except those treated
	    as lexical ("document element name is ...") or which are
	    mandatory for all SAX parsers (<em>DTDHandler</em>).
	    The Object must implement <a href="ext/DeclHandler.html"
	    ><em>org.xml.sax.ext.DeclHandler</em></a>.
	    </td>
	</tr>

    <tr>
	<td>dom-node</td>
	<td> For "DOM Walker" style parsers, which ignore their
	    <em>parser.parse()</em> parameters, this is used to
	    specify the DOM (sub)tree being walked by the parser.
	    The Object must implement the
	    <em>org.w3c.dom.Node</em> interface.
	    </td>
	</tr>

    <tr>
	<td>lexical-handler</td>
	<td> Used to see some syntax events that are essential in some
	    applications:  comments, CDATA delimiters, selected general
	    entity inclusions, and the start and end of the DTD
	    (and declaration of document element name).
	    The Object must implement <a href="ext/LexicalHandler.html"
	    ><em>org.xml.sax.ext.LexicalHandler</em></a>.
	    </td>
	</tr>

    <tr>
	<td>xml-string</td>
	<td> Readable only during a parser callback, this exposes a <b>TBS</b>
	    chunk of characters responsible for the current event. </td>
	</tr>

</table>

<p> All of these standard properties are optional;
XMLReader implementations need not support them.
</p>

<h2><a name="exceptions">SAX2 Standard Exception IDs</a></h2>

<p>SAX 2.1 defines a standard
<a href="SAXParseException.html#getExceptionId"
>SAXParseException.getExceptionId()</a>
method to identify which kind of error is being reported.
since any diagnostic message will vary between parsers.
Those identifiers are URIs, which are used in much the same way that
they are used for feature and property IDs.
Systems can define nonstandard IDs when needed, by using a
different base URI.
</p>

<p>Moreover, for the XML (and related) standards relied on by the SAX
specification itself (including <em>XML</em> and
<em>Namespaces in XML</em>), SAX also standardizes the IDs used
to identify those errors.
The identifiers all start with the exception base URI
<code>http://xml.org/sax/exception/</code>
which is then combined with additional information describing 
the error encountered.
Not all parsers will choose to provide all these IDs, but
those that provide any must only use the exception IDs defined by SAX.
Any errors defined by those specifications which are not yet
addressed by the SAX specification must not include any exception ID
(but see below, more identifiers can be defined).
</p>

<p>Parsers that correctly use exception IDs thus allow application
software to reason, in a parser-independent manner, about all
the basic XML errors that may be reported by an
<a href="XMLReader.html">XMLReader</a>.
For example,
they could assemble (and translate) catalogs of messages that make
more sense to their users, because they can use application context
to supplement a parser's textually oriented diagnostic.
In some cases they can write code that uses knowledge of the errors to
decide how to proceed most effectively.
For example, some validity errors might be of no concern,
while others might need to be treated as fatal.
</p>

<p> The core SAX identifiers are described here, and a more current
version might be available through <a href='http://www.saxproject.org'
>http://www.saxproject.org</a>,.
Parser writers should work with the SAX project to define standard ID
for any error cases that are identified in the relevant specifications,
but for which no IDs are defined here.
</p>

<h3>IDs for XML 1.0 Parsing Errors</h3>

<p>These IDs are derived from the current
<em>XML 1.0 (2nd edition)</em> recommendation.
The IDs start with the exception base URI, and append to that
<code>xml/</code> and then
an additional string that provides more specific identification of
the rule being violated.
Those additional strings are defined as follows:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><em>Grammar Violations</em> are identified by strings that
	start <code>rule-</code> and include the grammar rule number.
	For example, a violation of rule 42 (end tag syntax) would
	be reported using the additional string <code>rule-42</code>.
	(These are all fatal errors.)
	</li>

    <li><em>Well Formedness Constraint (WFC) Violations</em> are identified
	by strings that start <code>wfc-</code> and append the XML ID of the
	WFC being violated, as found in the source to the XML Recommendation.
	(Any leading <em>wfc-</em> or <em>wf-</em> is first removed;
	that source does not have a consistent naming convention for
	these identifiers.)
	For example, a violation of the <em>PEs in Internal Subset</em>
	WFC would be reported using the additional string
	<code>wfc-PEInInternalSubset</code>.
	(These are all fatal errors.)
	</li>

    <li><em>Validity Constraint (VC) Violations</em> are identified
	by strings that start <code>vc-</code> and append the XML ID of the
	VC being violated, as found in the source to the XML Recommendation.
	(Any leading <em>vc-</em> is first removed
	that source does not have a consistent naming convention for
	these identifiers.)
	For example, a violation of the <em>Root Element Type</em> VC would
	be reported using the additional string <code>vc-roottype</code>.
	(These are all validity errors.)
	</li>

</ul>

<p>So for example <code>http://xml.org/sax/exception/xml/rule-66</code>
indicates a violation of grammar rule 66 (a malformed character reference),
which is a fatal error.
And <code>http://xml.org/sax/exception/xml/vc-one-id-per-el</code>
indicates a violation of the <em>One ID per Element Type</em>
validity constraint, which is a validity error reflecting a
bug in the document's DTD.
</p>

<p> That list is subject to evolution for several reasons, such as:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>There are additional error cases defined in the XML Recommendation.
    These are situations where the text specifies that parsers must (or may)
    report an <em>error</em> or <em>fatal error</em>, although there is no
    applicable grammar rule or constraint.
    </li>

    <li>It may be desirable to assign similar IDs to <em>warning</em>s.
    Opportunities to issue standardized warnings are scattered through
    the XML Recommendation just like the error cases that don't relate
    to specific grammar rules.
    </li>

    <li> Some WF-ness violations could be attributed to more than one
    grammar rule, depending on how a parser detects the error.
    The general guideline is that the most specific applicable rule
    should be used.  (Otherwise everything could be blamed on
    a violation of rule 1!)
    Depending on how consistently parsers report such errors,
    it may not be practical for application code to rely heavily
    on the <code>rule-*</code> codes.
    <em>Reports of other errors, such as violations of VCs or WFCs,
    have no corresponding ambiguity issues.</em>
    </li>

    <li> In a similar vein, some rules are very complex and it may be
    desirable in some cases to provide even more specific
    information about a given error:  which clause of a complex rule
    triggered, which attribute value caused the problem, and so on.
    </li>

</ul>

<p> However, potential changes to the XML source of the XML Recommendation
which change those identifiers will not change that list.
Such cases would be addressed by applying these rules to a base revision
of that specification, and assigning IDs manually for such problem cases.
</p>

<h3>IDs for XML Namespaces Violations</h3>

<p>These IDs are derived from the current XML Namespaces recommendation.
    <!-- FIXME link via URL -->
The IDs start with the exception base URI, and append to that
<code>xmlns/</code> and then
an additional string that provides more specific identification of
the rule being violated.
Those additional strings are defined as follows:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><em>Namespace Constraint (NSC) Violations</em> are identified
	by additional strings that start <code>nsc-</code> and appending
	the XML ID of the NSC being violated, as found in the source to
	the <em>Namespaces in XML Recommendation</em>.
	(Any leading <em>nsc-</em> is first removed.)
	For example, a violation of the <em>Prefix Declared</em> NC would
	be reported using the additional string <code>nsc-NSDeclared</code>.
	Because these are (necessarily) not defined by the XML Recommendation,
	much less as as fatal errors, and they are clearly not just warnings,
	SAX parsers report these at the same level of severity they use
	for reporting validity errors.
	</li>
    
    <li><em>QName Violations</em> (such as using colons in interesting
	ways, such as <em>with:some:hierarchy</em>) are reported
	using the additional string <code>qname</code>.
	</li>

</ul>

<p>So for example
<code>http://xml.org/sax/exception/xmlns/qname</code>
might indicate an "localName" that begins with a digit,
which is a nonfatal error.
</p>

<p> That list is subject to evolution, although it has
substantially less need to evolve than the corresponding
list for XML 1.0 errors, since there are only two
NSCs and one other conformance constraint.
</p>
