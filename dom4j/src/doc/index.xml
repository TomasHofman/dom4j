    <title>DOM4J The Flexible XML Framework for Java</title>

    <header>
      <p><b>DOM4J</b> is an open and easy to use, interface-based Java API 
      for navigating and manipulating XML documents.</p>

      <p><b>DOM4J</b> combines the best of DOM, SAX, XPath and the 
      Java 2 platform to provide a flexible and powerful framework integrating 
      XML and Java.</p>

      <p><b>DOM4J</b> extends the Java 2 Collections framework to handle XML 
      documents allowing flexible plug and play implementations and has fully 
      integrated XPath navigation support from anywhere in the model.
